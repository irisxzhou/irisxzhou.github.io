          Hi! I'm <b>Iris</b>—a senior studying computer science at Harvey Mudd College.
      </h3>
      
      <p id='pleft'>
          This summer, I was in Redmond interning at <b>Microsoft</b> as a part of the <b>Windows Server Performance</b> team. I worked with PowerShell 6, upgrading an internal testing harness for Windows builds to .NET Core.
      </p>

      <p id='pright'>
          I will be graduating in <b>May 2020</b>, and am interested in software engineering roles, in any area of expertise—I'm still learning what I like to do, and am open to (and eager to) try new things!
          
      </p>
      <p>
          Outside of tech, I have a strong interest in music, design, and the arts.
          Some of things I've been working on recently, besides schoolwork:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Contributing bugfixes to the open-source Python library <a id="p" href="https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Airisxzhou">NLTK</a>
          <li>Listening to music and making <a id="p" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/125446176">Spotify playlists</a></li>
          <li>Creating art/design assets for <a id="p" href="https://muddescapes.com">MuddEscapes</a>, the series of student-built escape rooms at Harvey Mudd</li>
          <li>Working with clay in the ceramics studio (pictures to come soon!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Resume available upon request. Feel free to contact me at <b>izhou[at]hmc.edu</b> if you'd like to chat about opportunities, exchange music recommendations, or simply say hi!
      </p>
