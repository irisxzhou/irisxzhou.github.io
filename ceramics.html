        I took a ceramics class for the first time in 2017,
        and it undoubtedly changed my life.
      </h3>
      <p>
        It also changed my sleep schedule (I spent a lot of late nights in the 
        ceramics studio, trying to get assignments done). I took two more ceramics 
        classes and did some extra work-exchange semesters for no credit, chasing 
        the feeling of creating something from, essentially, dirt, and making
        it into something beautiful and meaningful.

        This page is very much a work in progress, as I haven't had as much time for 
        personal projects and updating this website as I'd like. Regardless, I mostly
        want a place to brag about the creative work I've done, so here are 
        some of the things I've made over the past few years:

      <p class='img-caption'>
      <b>Intimacy</b> (2017)
      <br>
      A personal piece describing a friendship that burned so bright that it burned itself out within a few months.
      This piece was displayed in Sprague Gallery's <a id='p' href='https://arts.hmc.edu/Ways-to-Know'>"Ways to Know"</a> exhibit, in spring 2018.
      </p>
      <img src='images/mobiuscups.jpg'>
      
      <p class='img-caption'>
        A closer look at the cups in the background of <b>Intimacy</b>. The handles are shaped after 
        MÃ¶bius strips, with the half-twist in separate directions.
      </p>

      <img src='images/reductionflare.jpg'>
      <p class='img-caption'>
        A reduction-fired bowl with a copper glaze. Normally, this glaze turns out red in an oxygen-poor environment, but 
        an oxygen flare in the kiln caused part of it to turn blue. I especially like the blurred effect where the red and blue 
        meet.
      </p>
      <img src='images/suprematismcups.jpg' >
      <p class='img-caption'>
        This pair of cups was made for an assignment, where we were to make cups emulating an art movement. My assigned movement was 
        <a id='p' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprematism'>Suprematism</a>, which is based on a limited set of geometric shapes
        and colors. The cups are not very useful (they are difficult to hold and drink from, and only hold
        a small amount of liquid), but I like how they turned out.
      </p>
      <img src='images/makersmark.jpg' > 
      <p class='img-caption'>
        My maker's mark. This swallow was stamped on the bottom of most of my work.
      </p>
      <img src='images/wip-kleinheart.jpg' >
      <p class='img-caption'>
        A work in progress shot from a class I took about sculpting the human form. This was a human heart, but with the 
        characteristic "twist" of a Klein bottle.  
      </p>
      <img src='images/foodset.jpg' >
      <p class='img-caption'>
        A set I created to go along with a menu I also designed and cooked for the class. This set was one of the last things I made at school,
        and I served food to my classmates from it a day before we were told to leave campus because of COVID-19.
